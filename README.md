## Installation

This was created using Node.Js and the Inquirer package.
    

## Usage

Simply navigate to the index.js file, open the Integrated Terminal, type "node index" and follow the onscreen prompts. Once the prompts are completed, an index.html and a style.css file will be created in the dist/ folder. The index.html is utilizing the Bootstrap framework and the CSS has minimal styling. Feel free to adjust and remove the stylings in the src/html-template.js file.
